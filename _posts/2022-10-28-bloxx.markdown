Hello,

This is my first post on my brand new github.io site.

Here, you will find posts about my favorites IT subjects such as Programming Language, Game Developpement and Tips.

But for the moment, just played with my tetris game :

- Left Arrow / Q    : Move Left
- Right Arrow / D   : Move Right
- Up Arrow / A      : Rotate Right
- E                 : Rotate Left
- Down Arrow / S    : Move Down
- Space :   Drop the piece
- H / Z :   Hold/Release the piece
- P to Pause the game
